                  rental fee specified in the booking details on the App (the

                  The Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lease Rental
                  comprises fees for the following: a) The usage of the Vehicle
                  for a pre-agreed mileage as indicated in the Booking details
                  on the App (referred to as the &quot;Agreed Mileage&quot;), b)
                  Platform usage fees, c) maintenance and repair costs, and
                  insurance/trip protection if applicable. d) Delivery fees, if
                  applicable, are also included. If the Lessee exceeds the
                  Agreed Mileage, they will be charged for the excess mileage at
                  the rate specified in the Fee Policy. Any discrepancy between
                  the actual mileage and the Agreed Mileage will be calculated
                  and settled by the Lessee and the Lessor upon the expiration
                  or termination of the Lease Term, with payment being made by
                  the Lessee to the Lessor or vice versa.

                  If the Lessee exceeds the Agreed Mileage or incurs any other
                  outstanding charges, they are responsible for paying such
                  amounts, which will be calculated based on the Fee Policy. The
                  Lessee may also be subject to penalties or late payment
                  charges for any prolonged default in settling these
                  outstanding amounts, as stated in the Fee Policy.

                  of such payments, the Lessee must reimburse the Lessor.

                  During the Lease Term and until the Vehicle is returned to the
                  Lessor in good working order/condition, the Lessee is solely
                  responsible for using the Vehicle in accordance with traffic
                  laws and regulations, including payment of tolls. Accordingly,
                  the Lessee shall be solely liable for all traffic violations
                  involving the Vehicle during the aforementioned period (the
                  &quot;Traffic Violation&quot;) and cost, penalty, fines and/or
                  charges imposed in respect thereof, including fines for late
                  payment, toll evasion/interstate taxes or any processing fees
                  added by the applicable regulatory authority(s). The Traffic
                  Violation includes, but is not limited to, illegal parking,
                  excess speeding, breaking a red light, photo enforcement, and
                  toll violations.

                  prescribed for taking necessary action in respect thereof
                  under Applicable Laws (for instance, if the case is being
                  brought to court). Afterwards, the Lessee shall immediately
                  pay the applicable fine/s to the relevant authority and
                  provide Lessor with confirmation of payment.

                  have the right to pay such amounts at its sole discretion, and
                  the Lessee shall reimburse the Lessor as soon as possible.

                  The Lessee is also liable if the Vehicle is confiscated,

                  return of the Vehicle in good operating condition to the
                  Lessor, for any reason attributable to the Lessee (&quot;

                  details as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours
                  prior to the expiration of the period prescribed by Applicable

                  the Lessor may, at its sole discretion, take all necessary
                  steps to secure the Vehicle&#39;s release. In such cases, the

                  Lessor for all costs and expenses associated with the release.

                  The Vehicle Insurance will provide the primary third-party
                  liability protection, which will be limited to the claims and
                  liabilities covered by the Vehicle insurer on the Vehicles for
                  any and all claims and/or liabilities that arise during the

                  This does not cover Own Damage, and the Lessee is responsible

                  the Lessee&#39;s failure to comply with the terms of this
                  Agreement. However, it is hereby clarified that if this
                  protection against third-party liability is extended by the
                  Lessor, it will not apply if the liability arises as a result
                  of the Lessee&#39;s negligence or breach of the pertinent
                  provisions of this Agreement.

                  The liability protection provided by the Vehicle Insurance is
                  limited to claims of third-party bodily injury, death, or
                  property damage, other than to the Vehicle, arising from the
                  permitted use of the Vehicle under this Agreement and
                  applicable law. Any such protection precludes claims made by
                  the Lessee, co-passenger, or immediate family members of the
                  Lessee or co-passenger who reside permanently with the Lessee
                  or were travelling with the Lessee at the time of the
                  incident. This obligation may be limited to the extent that
                  the coverage of Vehicle Insurance applies. In no event shall
                  the Lessor be liable to the Lessee and/or co-passenger(s) for
                  indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages
                  (including lost profits) arising out of or in connection with

                  return of the Vehicle to the Lessor in proper working
                  condition, the Lessee shall be responsible for all costs
                  incurred in rectifying or repairing the Vehicle due to such
                  damages, provided that the Lessee fulfills its obligations
                  under Clause 9.

                  Lessor in filing a complaint (in the case of theft) or making
                  an insurance claim. The Lessee shall provide all required
                  documentation and details of the accident or damage to enable
                  the Lessor to effectively manage the insurance claims.

                  situations where the Lessor is unable to submit a claim due to
                  actions (or lack thereof) attributable to the Lessee, repair
                  expenses shall be borne by the Lessee in cases where the

                  damage and the amount recovered/to be recovered under the
                  Vehicle Insurance. b) Theft/total loss of the Vehicle: (a) The
                  shortfall between the claim amount received under the Vehicle

                  its theft/total loss exceeds the Agreed Mileage, charge of the

              Your vehicle must comply with all safety, condition, and operation
              laws and regulations. A mechanical and safety inspection should be
              performed on your vehicle at least once a year. An inspection
              would cover the vehicle&#39;s most vital safety components, such
              as the brakes, steering components, tires, and lights.
